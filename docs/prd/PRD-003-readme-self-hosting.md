# PRD-003: README Self-Hosting Documentation

**Status:** Done
**Created:** 2026-01-29
**Parent:** PRD-001-audit-foundation.md (Gap: AC3)

---

## Problem Statement

The README.md doesn't reflect that this repository practices what it preaches:
1. `docs/prd/` directory not shown in repo structure
2. No mention that we use PDD for our own development
3. No link to PRD-000 or other PRDs
4. Prompt statistics showing 0/0/0 (appears broken)

Users visiting the repo don't see that we "dogfood" PDD, which:
- Reduces credibility ("do they even use this?")
- Misses opportunity to showcase real PRD examples
- Hides the PRD directory from discovery

## Solution

Update README.md to:
1. Add `docs/prd/` to repository structure diagram
2. Add "This Repository" section explaining we use PDD ourselves
3. Link to PRDs as real-world examples
4. Fix or remove broken prompt statistics

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Repository Structure Update
- [ ] `docs/prd/` appears in the repository structure diagram
- [ ] Structure shows it contains PRD files

### AC2: Self-Hosting Section
- [ ] New section titled "This Repository Uses PDD" or similar
- [ ] Explains we dogfood the methodology
- [ ] Links to `docs/prd/` directory
- [ ] Links to PRD-000 as the foundation document

### AC3: Prompt Statistics
- [ ] Statistics show actual values (not 0/0/0)
- [ ] OR section is removed if auto-generation is broken
- [ ] OR section explains how to regenerate stats

## Out of Scope

- Fixing the GitHub Action that generates stats (separate issue)
- Adding PRD status badges
- Creating a PRD index/dashboard

## Technical Notes

The prompt statistics are generated by `.github/workflows/update-readme-stats.yml`. If the workflow is broken, we should either fix it or remove the section to avoid confusion.
